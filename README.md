# Alpha-Project
Hi what's up ? I am working on a MMORPG, Survival, adventure, magic, steampunk, and cosy game with a friend. The game will be free for some people but unfortunately, the hosting server are really expensive so we are working on a simple hosting service or u can host on ur pc the game! Like Minecraft (bedrock) ! Ur progress will be saved on ur pc, or in the cloud (Not now). The game will have aswell a farming mechanic, a tech mecanic and ressources like wool, sticks, peebles,peebles lunchers, etc...
When u start the game, u will choose ur clan, and our clan give u a power ! More informations will drop soon...
