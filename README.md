### __PC only__, if the game will be known and appreciated, a __mobile version__ will be __considered__ (Android, iOS, IpadOS)



Hi what's up ? I am working on a MMORPG, Survival, adventure, magic, steampunk, and cosy game with a friend. The game will be __**free for some people**__ but unfortunately, the hosting server are really expensive so we are working on a simple hosting service or u can host on ur pc the game! Like Minecraft (bedrock) ! Ur progress will be saved on ur pc, or in the cloud (Not now). The game will have aswell **__a farming mechanic__**, a **__tech mecanic__** and ressources like wool, sticks, peebles, wood, etc...
When u start the game, u will choose ur clan, and our clan give you a power,not necessarily magic, but spoils will be on our discord server ! More informations will drop soon...
